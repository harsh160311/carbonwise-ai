# 🧠 Approach & Logic

The platform follows a simple environmental decision-making workflow:

```text
User Activities
        ↓
Carbon Calculation
        ↓
Emission Analysis
        ↓
Hotspot Detection
        ↓
AI Recommendations
        ↓
Reduction Simulation
        ↓
Progress Tracking
```

CarbonWise AI not only calculates emissions but also helps users understand why emissions occur and how they can reduce them.

---

# ⚙️ How The Solution Works

## Step 1: User Inputs Activities

Users enter:

- Daily transportation

- Shopping habits
- Waste generation

---

## Step 2: Carbon Calculation

The platform calculates estimated emissions using predefined emission factors.

Example:

```text
Transportation
+
Energy
+
Food
+
Lifestyle
=
Total Carbon Footprint
```

---

## Step 3: Emission Breakdown

The application identifies:

- Largest emission source
- Category percentages
- Environmental hotspots

---

- Awareness insights

---

## Step 5: Simulator

Users can test lifestyle changes and instantly view:

- Potential carbon savings
- Emission reduction percentages
- Improved sustainability scores

---

## Step 6: Progress Monitoring

Users monitor:

- Historical emissions
- Weekly improvements
- Long-term sustainability progress

---

# 📌 Assumptions Made

The following assumptions were made during development:

- User-provided data is assumed to be accurate.
- Carbon calculations are estimations based on publicly available emission factors.
- Results are intended for awareness purposes and not certified environmental audits.
- Sustainability scores are benchmark-based.
- Challenge completion is user-reported.
- Internet access is available for AI-powered features.
- Local storage is used for lightweight persistence in the MVP version.
